## Triggers
Having Left or Right trigger issues?

Are they registering most the time? - If so they may just need to be cleaned, see [Cleaning Triggers](../cleaning-triggers)

Nothing is registering or you have to push it very hard to get anything? If so they are likely worn beyond repair, and will need to be replaced. See [Replacing Triggers](../replacing-triggers)

## D-Pad or Buttons
Buttons not registering? Do they not really push or one of them just feel off?

Does pushing down hard allow them to register? do they feel crusty or sticky? If so see [Cleaning Membranes](../cleaning-the-buttons)

Do they not feel right? or one is diffrent than the rest? If so see [Replacing Membranes](../cleaning-the-buttons)

## Screen Issues
Top screen glitching out? Cracked? dead pixels?
